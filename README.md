Take-home assignment

To run this locally, do the following:
- npm install
- npm start

Then test the GET products endpoint by executing either:
- curl http://localhost:3000/brands/shike/products/Parents
- curl http://localhost:3000/brands/shike/products/Children
- curl http://localhost:3000/brands/shike/products/All

Model schema is in the models folder.
Endpoints description is in endpoints.txt.
My testing approach is in testing.txt.
What I think is missing from the mock is in missing.txt.
